## What kind of project is this?
This is a site with simulated registration, authorization and profile settings on the site.

## Why did I even start creating this project?

This is a project in which I tried to follow the rules of writing code for the site. The server part is written in the Go programming language (golang) and layout in HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript, SQL is used to work with the database (the database is stored on a local server - phpMyAdmin).
